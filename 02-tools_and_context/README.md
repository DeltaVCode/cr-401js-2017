## Learning Objectives
<!-- unordered list of learning objectives -->
* understand the difference between context and scope
* learn how to configure a function's context
* understand the roll context plays when using constructor functions

## Overview

#### package.json
* `package.json` is a config file that is used for configuring metadata about a node project
* it only requires a name and version, but typically contains much more information
* dependencies vs developer dependencies
  * dependencies - a list of packages required to run the main program
  * developer dependencies - a list of packages required to develop the project
* npm scripts are used to manage common tasks when working a node.js project  
* setting up a project
  * create a new directory for your project
  * navigate to that directory
  * run `npm init` and answer the questions
    * note: you can also run `npm init -y` to automate this process

#### Node Errors

###### Error
* a generic error
* `.stack` - a **String** describing the point in the code where the `Error` was instantiated
* `.message` - a **String** description set by calling the `new Error(message)`  

###### ReferenceError
* indicates that an attempt is being made to access a variable that is not defined
* `ReferenceError` is a subclass of `Error`  

###### SyntaxError
* indicates a program is not valid javascript
* `SyntaxError` is a subclass of `Error`  

###### TypeError
* indicates that a provided argument is not an allowable type
* `TypeError` is a subclass of `Error`    

###### SystemError
* `.code` - A **String** describing the error code
* `.errno` - A **Number** describing the error code
* `.syscall` - A **String** describing the system call that failed
* `SystemError` is **not** a subclass of `Error`
* Common System Errors
  * `EACCESS` - an attempt to access a file without the right permissions
  * `EADDRINUSE` - an attempt to start a server on a PORT that is already in use
  * `ECONNREFUSED` - a connection was deliberately refused by the target machine
  * `ECONNRESET` - a connection was forcibly closed by a peer
  * `EEXIST` - a file exists and the attempted action required that it didn't
  * `EISDIR` - an action expected to act on a file but found a directory
  * `EMFILE` - too many files were open for your operating system to handle
  * `ENOENT` - an action expected a file, but did not find one
  * `ENOTDIR` - an action expected a directory, but found something else
  * `ENOTEMPTY` - an action expected an empty directory, but found one with data in it
  * `EPERM` - an attempt to do something that you currently don't have permissions to do
  * `EPIPE` - an attempt to write data to a connection that had been closed

###### Throw Try Catch
* if an unhandled error is thrown, the program will crash
* `try`/`catch` blocks allow you to safely throw an error and handle it

### Call, Bind, Apply
* when a function has a `this`, we say that `this` is the function's context
* unlike scope, a function's context can be configured
* if a function is not a property on an object, by default it has no context
* if a function is a property on an object, by default, that object is the context for that function
* `call`, `bind`, and `apply` are function prototype methods that allow us to change the context of a function
* `call` is a method on a function that invokes a function with a specified context and arguments  
  * `call` passes comma separated arguments
* `apply` is a method on a function that invokes a function with a specified context and arguments  
  * `apply` passes arguments from an array  
* note: don't mess with the `__proto__` property - it's slow
  * if you want to determine an object's prototype, use `Object.getPrototypeOf(someObject)`
  * nesting a large amount of prototype methods will have a performance impact on your code - be careful!
