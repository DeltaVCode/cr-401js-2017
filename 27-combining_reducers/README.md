===

## Learning Objectives
* students will be able to combine reducers to simplify the management of complex application states
* students will be able to create meaningful tests through the use of jest and enzyme
* students will continue to work with the fundamental principles of redux to gain a better understanding on state management

## Resources
* read [combine reducers](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html)

## Overview
#### combineReducers
* reducers are great tools for defining state and state based changes to your applications
  * as your application state gets more complex, your reducers become hard to manage
  * this is where `combineReducers` comes into play
* `combineReducers` is a redux method that enables you to create a single reducer from many reducers that define sub states and their interactions
* a state returned from a combined reducer is an object where each _sub state reducer_ defines a property on that object

#### Testing
###### jest
* **jest** is a javascript testing framework with out of the box react support
* it includes a very similar API to that of mocha
* some methods include:
  * `describe` (same as mocha)
  * `beforeAll`, `afterAll` (same as mocha `before` and `after`)
  * `beforeEach`, `afterEach` (same as mocha)
  * `test` (same as mocha's `it`)
  * `expect` (similar to chai's `expect` syntax)
* we'll be using **jest** to test our application's actions, reducers, middleware, and components
