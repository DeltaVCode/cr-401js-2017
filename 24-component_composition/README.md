===

## Learning Objectives
* students will be able to utilize proper component composition constructs
* students will be able to compose react components through the use of props

## Resources
* read [conditional rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
* read [lists and keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
* read [composition vs inheritance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
* skim [thinking in react](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

## Overview
#### Component Composition
###### Composition  
* some components do not know their children ahead of time
* react components can use the special `children` prop to pass children directly into their output
  * for example, a `SpeechBubble` component could be passed a `SuccessMessage` or `ErrorMessage` component to be used as a child component

###### Specialization
* composition can be used to create special cases of another component
  * for example, a `Modal` component could be composed to create a `SignupModal` or a `LoginModal` component
